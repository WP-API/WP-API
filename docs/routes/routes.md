  values](http://codex.wordpress.org/Class_Reference/WP_Query#Status_Parameters).
  Default is "publish". (string)

#### `type`
The `type` parameter specifies the post type to retrieve. This can either be a
string or an array of types.

Note that arrays are specified using the `[]` URL syntax. e.g.

```
GET /posts?type[]=post&type[]=page
```

  GET /posts/<id>

  author). This is intended as a minimal subset of the user data to reduce
  response size. Returns the `parent` field as an ID, rather than an embedded
  post, to ensure we don't traverse the entire post hierarchy.

### Response
The response is a Post entity containing the requested Post if available. The
fields available on the Post depend on the `context` parameter.

--------------------
The Create Attachment endpoint is used to create the raw data for an attachment.
This is a binary object (blob), such as image data or a video.

  POST /media

### Input
The attachment creation endpoint can accept data in two forms.

The primary input method accepts raw data POSTed with the corresponding content
type set via the `Content-Type` HTTP header. This is the preferred submission
method.

The secondary input method accepts data POSTed via `multipart/form-data`, as per
[RFC 2388][]. The uploaded file should be submitted with the name field set to
"file", and the filename field set to the relevant filename for the file.

In addition, a `Content-MD5` header can be set with the MD5 hash of the file, to
enable the server to check for consistency errors. If the supplied hash does not
match the hash calculated on the server, a 412 Precondition Failed header will
be issued.
